## An AI-powered web app that detects deepfake images using TensorFlow and Streamlit. ##

## Features
- Real-time deepfake detection
- Hybrid neural network analysis
- Responsive image preview with adjustable sizing
- Detailed confidence metrics

**Model Architecture**
Backbone: Xception Network
Input Size: 299x299x3
Output: Real/Fake probability (0-1)

## Dataset
This project uses the **[Deepfake Detection Challenge Dataset]([https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images/data))** and similar public datasets. 
Due to size constraints, datasets are **not** included in this repository. Please download them separately from the source.
